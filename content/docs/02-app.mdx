## The AI Visibility Checker Agent

The AI Visibility Checker is a classic human-in-the-loop agent built as a web application. It helps you understand how visible your website is to AI models when they search for or answer questions about topics related to your brand.

**Live Demo:** [https://ai-ship-workshop.vercel.app/](https://ai-ship-workshop.vercel.app/)

## How It Works

The application follows a simple but powerful workflow:

**Input:** You provide your website URL on the landing page.

**Agent Processing:** The agent analyzes your website and checks its AI visibility across multiple AI models. To ensure accuracy and reliability, each check is performed three times and the results are averaged.

**Output:** You receive a table with AI visibility results for each AI model that shows how likely your website is to be referenced or recommended by AI models.
